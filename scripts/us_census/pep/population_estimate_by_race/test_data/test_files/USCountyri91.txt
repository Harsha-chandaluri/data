An explanation of the race and Hispanic origin categories used in this table can be found at

The estimates presented here were produced by a method which is still in a developmental stage.  They
may not be accurate for populations which are very small or have unusual race distributions and they may not
reflect recent changes in the distribution of the population with respect to race and Hispanic origin.  These
figures should be used with caution.
